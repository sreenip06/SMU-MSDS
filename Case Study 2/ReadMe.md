### Introduction

This project covers the details of exploratory analysis on Talent Turnover Analysis dataset provided to us. I did the required analysis on the dataset to answer key questions as well as gather interesting findings based on the data.

### Input Dataset

i. CaseStudy2-data.csv - Contains data on 870 employees along with Attrition information

### Key Analysis Questions

The analysis addresses the following key questions:

1. Where are the top factors driving attrition?
2. What is a robust model to predict attrition?
3. What are key insights from analysis based on Job Roles?

### Conclusions

- Overtime, Total Working Years, and Marital Status are among the top factors influencing Attrition
- A Naive Bayes model based on abive three variables gives a good classification model for Attrition
